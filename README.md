<h2>Project overview</h2>

This project is a prototype for an 'events' app for the older population, to get them more involved with the community, allowing them to make new friends etc.

From our research into the topic, we learned that loneliness is a huge problem that plagues the older population, especially in Ireland. Therefore, the idea behind this project was to create a solution to this issue. Events can be created by users, and "sponsored" by advertisers wishing to push their event to a larger userbase (generating income for us as a startup allowing us to improve our application)

Our market focus is retirees who arenâ€™t currently a part of an active retirement club. Currently there are quite few services in support of retirees and loneliness can be an issue. The only other services that address this problem are [websites](https://activeirl.ie/)  with features made obsolete by a phone app. The solution we are working on, our application that allows retirees to connect with one another and form groups (for example bowling and knitting groups). Will provide a cheaper solution to the problem most prominently solved by retirement homes at a fraction of the cost for end-users.

To develop this project, we used android studio and (of course) GitHub to corroborate changes and work. We primarily used Java to code, and XML to work on page layouts.

We also made use of Firebase to store data for the project, along with allowing for secure user authentication.

<h2>Using the app</h2>

Our users can register, log their favorite passtimes and bio etc, then get searching for events in their area that may interest them. We have an event maker on the app, where the user can choose if they want to sponsor the ad, or have it appear (for free) in the general area.

The app can be seen running in the following [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/02aM8TG) taken of the prototype (25/04/2022)
We tried to stick closely to the [wireframes](https://imgur.com/a/I7Loqyh) we orignally created when brainstorming.

The code can currently be run in android studio using an emulator, or a physical device if you possess one.
